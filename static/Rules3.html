    In the diagram to the right, it is the Cylinder Player&apos;s turn and all the cylinders blink to indicate that
    none have moved yet. For simplicity, only a small section of the board is shown. Please assume 
    that the blue and red cylinders blink.

    When the Cylinder Player clicks / selects the red cylinder a group of cyan coloured dots appear to
    indicate the valid moves possible.

    When the Cylinder Player moves the blue cylinder to the adjacent red hexagon,
    the blue cylinder becomes steady to indicate that it has moved this turn. The board shows this:

    When the Cylinder Player now clicks / selects the blue cylinder in the same turn, a single cyan dot is 
    shown indicating the start position at the beginning of this turn.<br>
    Whilst the turn timer is running it 
    is possible for any cylinder to retract it&apos; s move and return to it&apos;s original position at the start of 
    the turn. The cylinder may then be moved to a new position as desired.
    <br>This option is useful to correct
    a mistake and can also be used to execute the maneuver &quot;indirect pass through&quot;. 
    Please refer to next section.

  8) Indirect Pass Through
</b></h2>
  
<div class="rowM1">
  <div class="columnM1">
    This maneuver, achievable in one turn, involves two pieces of the same shape. In this example, it is the Blocks Player&apos;s 
    turn and for strategic reasons, yellow block is needed the other side of the purple block. The procedure is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Purple block moves to the adjacent black hexagon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yellow block moves along the edge for two hexagons to land on a blue hexagon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Purple block retracts it&apos;s original move and returns to it&apos;s start position of a black hexagon
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>
    (NB Optionally, purple block may now move again as in effect it has not yet moved this turn)
    </i></p>
