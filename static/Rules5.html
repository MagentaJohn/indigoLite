  12) Random Events
</b></h2>
  <p> If configured, random events may occur at the end of any turn with a probability that is configured at the start
    of the game. Such events might include:
  <ul>
  <li>"Windy Flip" ... all pieces on the board are flipped</li>
  <li>"Blue Recall" ... both blue pieces are returned home (blue is just an example)</li>
  <li>"Yellow Sink Holes" ... all pieces on a yellow hexagon are returned home (yellow is just an example)</li>
  <li>"Cylinder Power" ... all cylinders gain +1 attacking or defending for that turn (cylinder is just an example)</li>
  </ul>
