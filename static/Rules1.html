<h2><b>
1) Object of the Game
</b></h2>
<p>Flic Flac is a timed <span class="myBoldGreen">(N seconds)</span> turn based game. The first player <span class="myBoldGreen">to score 11</span> or more captures, with a lead of 2 captures, is the winner. This page summarises the rules. The following pages give more explanations and example game scenarios.</p>

<h2><b>
2) Movement
</b></h2>

<p>All 6 pieces may optionally move once in each timed turn (and successful capture(s) lead to an additional limited turn).  A piece may not directly pass through, or land on another piece. There are two ways a piece can move:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Up to 3 coloured hexagons</li>
  <li>Onto an adjacent black hexagon, which causes the piece to flip over so that the centre colours change.</li>
</ul>
<p>A piece returns to its home position when it is captured. An additional turn, <span class="myBoldGreen">of shorter duration,</span> is chained onto the end of the current turn, when an opponent's piece(s) is captured. This turn is limited to the captor(s). More captures leads to more additional turns.<br>
<i>(NB. There is a maneuver called “indirect pass through” which helps pieces reposition. Please see example scenarios on later pages)</i></p>

<h2><b>
3) Capture
</b></h2>

<p>The game is played from a 2D top down view point. Each piece has a body colour (in 2D this is the outer rim) and two colours visible in the centre area. This is the top of the piece. There are two different colours hidden on the bottom of the piece.<br>
<ul>
<li>A piece is said to be "flying" a colour if that colour is one of the two colours shown on the current top face.</li>
<li>A piece is said to be "empowered" if it stands on a hexagon of it's own body colour.</li>
</ul>
Adjacent pieces form a “melee” at the adjoining border(s).  Pieces may only attack, defend and support across borders when the flying colours match the target body colour. No colour match means no positive points gained across that border for that piece. At the start of a “melee” each piece has a score of zero and this is adjusted, <b>for all pieces,</b> as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>+1 for each piece flying the body colour of an adjacent piece.</li>
<li>+2 for each empowered piece flying the body colour of an adjacent piece.</li>
<li>-1 if an opposing piece has scored +1 as above.</li>
<li>-2 if an opposing piece has scored +2 as above.</li>
</ul>
At the end of the turn, pieces with a negative score are captured and restart from their home positions.<br>
<i>(NB The same scoring system applies <b>for all pieces</b> at the end of each turn, so losses on both sides are possible.)</i>
</p>

<h2><b>
4) Random Events
</b></h2>
<p> <span class="myBoldGreen">If configured,</span> random events may occur at the end of any turn with a 
  <span class="myBoldGreen">probability of 1 in 100.</span> Such events are listed on the last page of these guidelings.
</p>


<p><i>(NB Parameters in <span class="myBoldGreen">Green</span> are configurable from the configuration screen)</i></p>
