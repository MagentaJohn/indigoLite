Prologue
</b></h2>
<p class="first">
The retreat of the early morning mist from the rising sun mysteriously halted halfway across Wintancaester bridge. Here, a solitary, shabby peasant leant against a handcart in clear view. The druids he had secretly summoned from the forest, remained enveloped in the cloud beyond. He had no doubt that this veil was created by their deceptive magic.
</p>
<p>
‘My position is impossible. It would seem my closest allies are my worst enemies,’ the peasant continued. This was no ordinary peasant. It was King Aethelstan in disguise. He had evaded his own city guard by stealth to hold this surreptitious meeting.
</p>
<p>
The year was 926 and during his reign so far, the king had allowed his royal entourage to believe he had always been celibate. Without a legitimate heir, the king was perceived to be an unselfish leader, prioritising the good of his realm and the country above himself. 
</p>
<p>
‘There are those amongst my courtiers who have discovered the existence of my lad and now threaten his life for their personal gain. I command you to reveal the identity of the traitors before it is too late.’
</p>
<p>
A soft druid voice from the mist replied: ‘The ways of Wintancaester are unknown to us. Have you not more to say, Aethelstan of Wessex?’
</p>
<p>
The king hesitated. Should he trust these druids again, hiding in the mist? So far the treaty had remained steadfast. He could not act publicly without revealing his son and heir, thus weakening his hold on the throne. It would seem his son would surely meet with an “accident” unless he invoked the druids’ help. There was no alternative. He spoke in an undertone such that only those close at hand would hear:
</p>
<p>
‘Last year I secretly dispatched my son to Corfe Castle, where the commander is my friend of old, Baron Wilfred De Gorges. Since then, my informants report a conspiracy involving an assassin already established at Corfe, waiting for a signal. To ensure your favour, I have later entrusted the prism artefact to a simple servant selected at random, as you requested. By chance, I believe this servant has also arrived at Corfe— It is time for you to honour your side of our agreement.’
</p>
<p>
The swirl of vapour intensified in front of the king, almost engulfing the handcart before him.
</p>
<p>
‘We do not know your adversary in Wintancaester. We do not know the slayer at Corfe. We do not know your son since you have kept him from us. We do not know the servant, for you gave no sign. Yet you ask for our help?’
</p>
<p>
The king folded his arms, maintained a stern countenance and remained silent. Had he acted unwisely? After a few moments the response came:
</p>
<p>
‘Very well. You have released the prism of presage, from your treasury. In return, we shall endeavour to assist. Our alliance shall hold, although we cannot foresee the cost. Speak to no one of our involvement and we may yet prevail.’
</p>
<p>
The king would have sought for greater reassurances. Instead, the mist started to unfurl. The far end of the bridge, leading to the forest, appeared before his eyes. The druids had vanished without a glimpse. There was not a soul to be seen in the dawn light.
</p>
<p>
He pushed the empty, rickety cart back to the city unnoticed, making a mental note to reprimand the city guard for their lack of diligence. King Aethelstan discarded the peasant attire and restored his fine garments and crown. Now he needed to discover who was behind the treachery. What else could be done to rescue the situation at Corfe? Perhaps he had done enough already?
</p>
<p>
If only he could see far across the land and behold Corfe Castle, along with all the events that were about to unfold.

Chapter 1 ~ The Night Watch
</b></h2>
<p class="first">
‘Hell’s bells and buckets of blood!’ roared Pluskas, captain of the castle prison guard, fourth in command of the master's infantry and a member of the “Swords Elite”. 
</p>
<p>
‘What in blazes has happened here? You were tasked with keeping the prison secure; ensuring nobody got in; AND NUMB SKULLS, NOBODY GOT OUT!’ 
</p>
<p>
The companions in front of the fuming captain observed the pewter beer tankards on the shelf rattling with the sheer volume of sound, as the last words were delivered. 
</p>
<p>
Pip knew they needed to distract the captain somehow, but he did not know how this could be done. The note they had found in the empty locked cell would only make their position more precarious if the captain laid eyes on it. Pip could not figure out how the prisoners had escaped in the first place. He now held the keys to the cell, still bound together by a frayed cord. These had always been on the table, out of the captives’ reach. The companions had been on duty all night and mostly alert. Each morning they would usually be routinely awoken by the castle cat, begging for food, but not this morning. Where was Kippers the cat?
</p>
<p>
The night watch consisted of three good friends, Sandro, Pip and Jofftal. Captain Pluskas knew that these were half-decent scoundrels. He had often thought to himself. <i>If only I could meld the trio of recruits into one man, I might at least have one solid soldier to command in this watch.</i>
</p>
<p>
The captain’s impression was that Sandro had the strength but not the intelligence of a soldier. Sandro was considered by some to be a simpleton. He was easily befuddled by long words and detailed commands. Pip was exactly the opposite, a smart little guy with no fighting ability. Then there was Jofftal. The infernal character always had an answer for everything. He had an innate ability to get under the captain’s skin. 
</p>
<p>
Pluskas reflected on the wisdom of agreeing to continue his service for so long. What a mess. Escaped prisoners! His reputation was at stake again. It was time to make these dunderheads squirm.
</p>
<p>
‘Well you worms, what have you got to say for yourselves?’ As the captain stepped forward, the three companions retreated to find the iron bars of the empty locked prison pressing into their backs. 
</p>
<p>
‘Respecting the captain, we got half the job done,’ Jofftal piped in. 
</p>
<p>
Pip grimaced. He knew that his friend should not have said that, but it was too late. 
</p>
<p>
‘What! — What do you mean?’ bellowed Pluskas. 
</p>
<p>
Whilst facing the captain, Pip calmly repositioned himself so that his right hand twisted the cell key to unlock the prison door behind his back. 
</p>
<p>
Jofftal continued: ‘Well captain sir, we did not let anyone in— did we sir?’
</p>
<p>
That was entirely too much for Captain Pluskas, captain of the castle prison guard, fourth in command of the master's infantry and a member of the Swords Elite. The brief reflection of his purple face in his swiftly drawn sword was a sure indication that the three comrades were about to have their ranks reduced. 
</p>
<p>
The prison door scraped open. Pip smartly dragged his companions into the cell and locked the door, dodging the thrust meant for his friend. As long as they stayed back from the vertical iron shafts separating their hostile commander and his menacing sword from themselves, they might yet live. Surely things could not get worse.
</p>
<p>
During the rushed retreat into the cell, Sandro had lost his footing and had grabbed the prison bars to stay upright. The feather-light parchment entrusted to him by his friends to hide, had slipped from his hand and gently floated to the pebble floor. Pluskas could not help but notice that one of his wretched, good-for-nothing, night watchmen had become distracted. It took only a moment longer to follow the line of sight and identify the note waiting to be discovered. 
</p>
<p>
‘Aha. What's this?’
</p>
<p>
Pip frowned again in recognition that things had indeed just gotten worse. Underlining the seriousness of the situation, Jofftal was quiet for once. Meanwhile, Sandro had just realized that the punctual creature, Kippers the cat, was late for her breakfast. 
</p>
<p>
The captain, regaining his composure, read the note aloud, in sheer disbelief:
</p>
<p class="notesingle">
Salutations Sandro, Pip and Jofftal,
</p>
<p class="notebody">
Thank you for your hospitality and our engaging discourse this evening. My friends enjoyed hearing about the exploits of your remarkable captain. Unfortunately, in order for them to learn more about the aforementioned esteemed individual, my friends deem it to be necessary to keep their heads attached to their bodies. Therefore, on this occasion, they regretfully decline your gracious offer of overnight accommodation. We hope we will meet you and your captain in more favourable circumstances. Departing with our spirits lightened— 
</p>
<p class="notesingle">
Kippers
</p>
<p class="notesingle">
(Mouse catcher extraordinaire, first in command of castle creatures and honorary member of the Swords Elite.)
</p>
<p>
‘What?,’ whispered Pluskas, ‘Salutations, Hospitality?’ As Pluskas crescendoed, the beer tankards started to rattle again, reminding Sandro that he was thirsty for another beer. 
</p>
<p>
‘Engaging discourse— Regretfully decline— Esteemed individual— First in command— Honorary member— Swords Elite— Overnight accommodation. Am I running a damn village inn here?’ Pluskas paused before erupting.
</p>
<p>
‘Do you want to live? Tell me. Do you want to live?’
</p>
<p>
It was very unlikely that any prison wall or set of bars was going to keep the captain out of the cell for very long. 
</p>
<p>
‘Throw me the keys,’ commanded the captain in a tone which did not brook refusal. 
</p>
<p>
Pip considered his position. He sadly concluded that things had gotten worse again. There was no point in denying the captain. He might actually skin them alive if he did not obey. Perhaps the captain would regain a little of his composure if the keys were restored to him. With a sigh, Pip made the call and flung the keys across the floor. They skidded between two bars to finally clatter into the captain’s boot.
</p>
<p>
With a deft flick of his sword against his boot, Captain Pluskas hooked the keys upward. He plucked them out of mid-air, whilst scornfully disdaining the sight of those wretched individuals that proudly constituted his night watch. There they were, three soldiers now cowering behind bars. Enough was enough. <i>I'll show them who is running their village inn here.</i> Attaching the keys to the straining belt that emphasized his portly build, he walked out of the dungeon, chortling to himself, to tackle another important matter, castle breakfast. Today had not started well, hopefully there would be some fresh steamed eggs to improve his disposition.
</p>
<p> 
Sandro's mind was slowly catching up, although he did not understand what salutations meant. Or was that satulations? After a few moments he remarked:
</p>
<p>
‘I thought we were supposed to be on the other side of the bars. Hey Pip, what are satulations, can you eat them? Can Kippers really write? How does she hold the quill? Has she done that before?’
</p>
<p>
Pip and Jofftal looked at each other and shook their heads. It was going to be a long, uncomfortable stay. Hopefully, after sufficient ridicule, the next watch would be able to retrieve the keys and let them out. It was confusing though, this was the first time they had been locked in a cell whilst on guard duty. Also, how exactly did those prisoners escape?
</p>
<p class="center">
*
</p>
<p>
The uneven floor was filthy so the three friends sat on the cold ledges. These were some of the larger stones protruding from the rugged wall. It was impossible to find a comfortable position.
</p>
<p>
Sandro was still puzzling over how a cat could write a note. Maybe cats went to school to learn this. He wished he had gone to school, then he would know much more stuff.
</p>
<p>
Pip tried to get some more sleep. There was nothing else to do. No point in worrying. Just wait to be released and then find a way to get back into the captain's good books.
</p>
<p>
Jofftal was engrossed. He had plenty to think about. He kept replaying the scene over and over again in his mind. Should he have acted? He had been dozing with his head on the table when he partially saw, out of the corner of one eye, the keys sliding across the table. He knew there was no one else but the prisoners and the guards in the dungeon. The prisoners could not reach the keys. Jofftal suspected witchcraft. If one of the prisoners was a witch, then he would be under a spell as soon as he moved, so he had relaxed and remained perfectly still. If only he could have reached the magic artefact within his inside pocket, the prism of presage. 
</p>
<p>
The prism of presage was a gift to Jofftal from the king himself. The king had bestowed it on him in secret and declared Jofftal to be the royal witch hunter. A clandestine title that Jofftal held with pride, whose mandate he must always serve in secret. The surface of the stone changed texture in the proximity of a witch. The king had dispatched Jofftal undercover, armed with this prism, to traverse the land. He was tasked to hunt down witches in all their forms. 
</p>
<p>
One of the prisoners was an old woman. Jofftal thought he had seen her before and sensed that he was in danger. Yet, what should he have done?
</p>
<p>
At last, the sound of jingling keys disturbed the three companions as the next team of guards approached the dungeons. After three rounds of ale and a banquet of jokes at their expense, the night watch was finally released to continue their duties for the day.
</p>
<p class="ooo">
oooooooooOOOooooooooo

<h2><b>
Chapter 2 ~ Metal Bones
</b></h2>
<p class="first">
The evening before, the castle stronghold at Corfe seemed to be nestling down into the lush green hills of southern England, ready for its nightly repose. The castle was happily situated on one of the largest, steepest hills in the valley, halfway between the town of Werham and the Purbeck coast. The stronghold was renowned for providing a safe haven for the villagers and country folk when the lands were invaded by marauders. In these days such incursions were all too common. 
</p>
<p>
A great portcullis gate and a chain-operated drawbridge were only the start of the imposing castle entrance. Unlike the other defensive fortresses in the country, Corfe Castle had one particular claim to fame. The walls had never been breached. Many armies had passed on in frustration, after weeks of laying siege, attempting to starve out the garrison and all those who had sought refuge. The castle, with its deep well, majestic keep, panoramic views and certain secrets known only to a few, seemed to be enchanted. So far, immune to siege, starvation and skullduggery.
</p>
<p>
As dusk began to fall, a shadow flitted across the face of the castle walls. The shadow seemed to melt into the contours of the stone. With the languid confidence of one for whom Corfe Castle had long been home, the owner of the shadow moved along the ledge formed by the foundation stones. At her favourite point, she stepped on to the stone that protruded further than the rest. She swayed her head to measure the distance and then performed the carefully calculated jump. Well, of course, all jumps were carefully calculated. She alighted on one of the narrow window gaps in the south-facing side of the main wall and sat, in a pensive manner, overlooking the drawbridge. 
</p>
<p>
It had been another day of balanced fortune, most of which had been spent sleeping up her second favourite tree, waiting for the enemy of old to tire, or to become bored and leave her tree alone. It seemed that venturing outside her castle became more dangerous every week. Perhaps it was time to move on to a new home. Once again, hunting had been fruitless, but the village trader had missed her stealing away a fish from the barrow. He was too busy boasting about the quality of a chair he was trying to sell to a passing local. She knew that the ‘uniquely hand-carved chair of oak’ was poorly constructed, she had watched him repair it many times, but she could not tell anyone. Stupid villager. Stupid trader. Stupid people.
</p>
<p>
In fact, on reflection, all people were more than just stupid, they were also, oh so smelly. She could smell the muck on their shoes, the food on their breath, and the sweat in their garments. Why did they not wash themselves? If only they licked themselves clean all over every day, then they would not smell like that. How could they stand it? Why did they wear all manner of items to cover themselves up? Was it the smell or did people get cold? Surely, if they got cold then they should grow fur like she did. ‘Stupid two-legged people, I have no use for them at all.’ 
</p>
<p class="center">
*
</p>
<p>
This was the considered opinion of Kippers the cat, mouse catcher extraordinaire and self-proclaimed leader of all castle creatures. As an afterthought, she also decided to adopt the title ‘honorary member of the Swords Elite’. Kippers had no notion what this might mean, but she had heard it before and decided that it sounded far too important not to be part of her full feline title. ‘Why I have to catch all the rodents around here without any help is a mystery to me,’ she would often remark to herself. ‘I am far too beautiful to do this work.’ 
</p>
<p>
Indeed Kippers was a fine-looking puss, with sapphire blue eyes. She had a snow-white coat all over, except for her nose, ears, tail and the bottom part of each leg, which she called her boots. These were all black. As a very clever cat, she had designed her outfit just like this so that these black bits did not need washing so much. ‘Garments indeed, how stupid can they get.’
</p>
<p>
The light was fading and she would soon need to adopt her nocturnal stealth mode, highly recommended for tense mouse chases. First, a quick visit to the dungeon cells where she was normally able to scrounge a splash of milk from the guards on duty. She never knew which set of guards to expect, but she could outsmart them all. If not for the horrible odour emanating from this place, she might be tempted to stay longer. Kippers drew a deep breath and jumped down to the floor. She strode along to the second corridor on the left, then down the stairs. Kippers knew the entire castle layout and reckoned she could find her way around with eyes shut if she wanted to. Third arch on the right and here we are, the so-called dungeon. This evening it appeared that some of her favourite guards were on duty. They met with her approval because they were the easiest to beguile. 
</p>
<p>
But wait, her senses became heightened and she flattened herself to the floor. Yes, all the horrible smells were there, but also, unmistakably, the scent of a mouse. Where are you hiding mousey? Kippers took time to adjust her saucer-like eyes to the flickering candle-light, it must have been later than she thought. She tuned her ears to detect the slightest scratch. The pewter tankards were on the table, along with the sleeping head of one of the guards. There were the other two, snoring away in their chairs. They often seemed to sleep like that after their drinks. Stupid people, but never mind them, where is that mouse? Now Kippers was endowed with great patience. Whilst she waited she repeated her mouse hunting ditty:
</p>
<p class="scroll">
Run mousey run, hide where you can<br/>
Your time has come, so understand<br/>
You may be scrawny or you may be fat<br/>
But you cannot escape Kippers the cat<br/>
</p>
<p>
She held her ‘ready to spring’ stance for a few minutes while determining the location of her quarry. Indeed, her senses had not failed her, there was a mouse in the corner of the guardroom behind a beer barrel. 
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Kippers’ mouse, somehow aware that his presence had been detected, darted across the floor, under the iron bars to avoid the predator. 
</p>
<p>
Kippers had not expected this turn of events. In her feline mind she thought:
</p>
<p>
‘Wait a moment, what's this, the cell seems to have three people occupants and one has captured my mouse! That's not right at all, that's my mouse, not yours. You’re supposed to jump on chairs, scream and shout. Generally spoiling any chance I have of executing my given right to finish mousey off. Stupid, stupid people. I can't believe it. Now what’s going on?’
</p>
<p>
The mouse had run straight into the outstretched cupped hands of the girl sitting on the floor. The girl lifted the mouse up in her hands and held it in front of her. Kippers was beside herself. She thought that humans were stupid enough, but as she looked at this mouse, she thought the mouse had lost all his senses.
</p>
<p>
Dressed in rags, with unkempt long hair, the girl was decidedly thin, but not unattractive. Kippers was an expert in all matters feminine. She thought that, given a chance and change of circumstances, the girl could even be alluring for a human. No matter what she looks like she should not have my mouse. Time to get a better look at her face. 
</p>
<p>
As Kippers circled outside the cell, she realized to her horror that there was more to this girl than met the eye. It was her eyes that Kippers now noticed. She did not have human eyes, she had mouse eyes. <i>That can't be true,</i> she thought to herself. Worse still, she peered very closely at her mouse who seemed unafraid, as if they were talking. 
</p>
<p>
They were talking! There was a twitch from the mouse, a movement of the tail, and the girl responded with facial expressions and little high-pitched noises. Never in Kipper’s life had she encountered anything like this before.
</p>
<p>
Transfixed by what was unfolding in front of her, before Kippers had realised, the girl gently let the mouse back onto the floor and now gazed at her. The mouse ran off, but Kippers did not notice this. She stared directly into the eyes of the girl, which seemed to call her to the cell. They were no longer mouse eyes but the most luminous cat eyes Kippers had ever seen. Her whiskers told her that slipping through the bars would be a tight squeeze but she needed to respond to the call. Yes, she must go through the bars into the cell.
</p>
<p>
Somehow the girl knew how cats talked. Not only could she understand all the outward signs, such as swishing the tail, blinking the eyes and flattening the ears. She also knew about the secret cat language that could only be discerned when a cat purrs. Kippers purred, as the girl stroked the cat with loving tender hands. The guards slept through this close encounter. It took about an hour for the girl to provide the answers to the many questions that had vexed Kippers all her life, but in return, Kippers had an important task to do. Easy for a cat but impossible for this wonderful, clever, girl.
</p>
<p>
Out through the bars, up onto the table, bite down on the string with the keys. The girl had called the keys ‘metal bones’ to make it easy for Kippers to understand. Then bring the cord and the metal bones back to the cell. All the time, the night watch slept, blissfully unaware that the cell door was being unlocked from inside. The girl and her two other companions, were free to go. Remembering the conversation with her captors earlier this afternoon, the girl amused herself by writing a note to the night watch. After all, she could not wake them but wanted to say thank you for not being as harsh as their previous captors. The parchment and quill were to be found on the shelf and Kippers wanted to see how this type of crazy human thing was done.
</p>
<p>
‘Amazing’, indicated Kippers. ‘Never mind the note, I would have just peed on his boots and be done.’ With that, the prisoners followed Kippers the cat, who knew all the devious unguarded routes through the castle. Before long, they were out in the cool, fresh night air and had scrambled down the hill. Easy for a cat, but not for the clumsy, two-legged friends she had just rescued. 
</p>
<p>
‘Stupid people,’ thought Kippers, but in her considered opinion, she might make an exception for the straggly girl, named Gwennic.
